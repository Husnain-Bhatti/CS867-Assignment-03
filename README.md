##  Classification Using CNN
Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network ( “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This Assignment is a deep dive into details of the deep learning ResNet50 architecture with a focus on learning using Transfer learning for image classification.
This assignment is classification problem which is solved ResNet50 architecture of CNN.
### Dataset
This is the Data of Natural Scenes around the world.
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories
i.e. Buildings, Forest, Glacier , Mountain, Sea and Street.
The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in
Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
You are supposed to work in following manner:
• Training set = 14k+ 150x150 Images in seg_train folder for training spread.
• Validation set = 3k+ 150x150 Images in seg_test folder for cross-validation spread.
• Test set = 7k+ 150x150 Images in seg_pred folder as test spread.
