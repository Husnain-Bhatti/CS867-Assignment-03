##  Classification Using CNN
Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network ( “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This Assignment is a deep dive into details of the deep learning ResNet50 architecture with a focus on learning using Transfer learning for image classification.
